# Cumulative-Cooccurance-Index (CCI) is an objective measure of inter-channel occurrences of high-frequency events in multichannel LFP/EEG (any time series) recordings.
# The actual source code is the 'Compute_Ripple_Co_Occurace_Stat.m'
# The demo code 'demo_CCI.m' is a a demonstration of CCI using indices of ripples or HFEs in 5 time series (TTX_CW2_D1_Channel_1_Indices_of_Rpl_Peaks, TTX_CW2_D1_Channel_2_Indices_of_Rpl_Peaks, TTX_CW2_D1_Channel_3_Indices_of_Rpl_Peaks, TTX_CW2_D1_Channel_4_Indices_of_Rpl_Peaks, TTX_CW2_D1_Channel_5_Indices_of_Rpl_Peaks)
